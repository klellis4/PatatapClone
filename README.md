# Patatap Clone Project

Each key press animates a circle on the page, and plays a quick sound file.
Each key is associated with a circle color and sound file. When pressed, the circle appears on a random point
on the screen and shrinks out of view while changing color and playing sound.

Uses Paper.js and Howler.js
